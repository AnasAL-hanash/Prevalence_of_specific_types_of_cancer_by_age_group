Prevalence of specific types of cancer in different age groups using Python

Description
This project includes Python code to analyze a dataset related to cancer diseases (for example, the prevalence of different types of cancer in different age groups) and use matplotlib to create a graph that helps in understanding the data.

Requirements
To run this project, you will need to install the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib

How to run
To run the code, you can simply run the attached Jupyter Notebook file (Prevalence_of_specific_types_of_cancer_by_age_group.ipynb) which contains all the steps and instructions needed to execute the code. Alternatively, you can run the code in the file Prevalence_of_specific_types_of_cancer_by_age_group.py directly using Python.

Code Output
The graph will show how cancer types are distributed across age groups

Notes
The data has been randomly generated to illustrate how to perform analysis and visualizations using the tools available in Python.
